# Reviewer 1
- Step 1 is not clearly reported in Methods but, rather, in the results (Maybe other stuff as well)
	- *Reconsider the layout. The results should be shorter and only contain the ACE/Beta comparison-specific data*
- Confusion with the word "cohort"
	- *Book of OHDSI: Section 10.1*
	- *Cohort is a set of persons one or more inclusion criteria for a duration of time. It can be used interchangeably with phenotype*
- More detail in the derivation of the PS
- Should focus on a single outcome for risk stratification
- Outcomes may co-occur leading to confounding and/or effect modification that is not addressed
	- *Need help with that*
	- In presentations of this work to LUMC, we had questions on how we deal with competing risks. Is it related?
	- *Should we include in discussion or do we need to make more steps?*
- Present a traditional Table 1 instead of the one used now
- HTE not described sufficiently
- Test to compare the c-statistics
- Present all results from all databases

# Reviewer 2
- Present more synthesis and less of just reporting the results --> **BIG**
- Need to address other sources of heterogeneity, e.g. timing of events, particulars of the databases,...
- Present a reference method, so that current results can be evaluated
	- *Compare with the constant treatment effect assumption?*
- Why was LASSO preferred instead of other methods? Generally, explain more why specific approaches were chosen
- Make more clear what a citation is about. Don't leave people searching for what you mean
